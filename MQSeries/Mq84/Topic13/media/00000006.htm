<H1>MQ84 - Topic 13: MQSeries for Windows</h1>

<FONT SIZE="+2"> Positioning </FONT>
<br>
MQSeries for Windows is designed as a single user workstation. This type of queue manager is called a leaf node queue manager. It uses significantly fewer resources than other queue managers by providing fewer functions.
<P>
Click the words Leaf node Queue Managers to see the available versions.
<br><br><br>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Family differences</FONT>
<br>
This is a summary of functions that are not available on MQSeries for Windows.
The features in the second part of the screen are supported only in MQSeries for Windows Version 2.1, but not in Version 2.0.
<P>
Most of the features listed are self-explanatory, but a few require more clarification.
<P>
Move the mouse over the red text to see more details.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Distributed queuing features</FONT>
<br>
MQSeries for Windows introduces additional  features to simplify the handling of  connections to other queue managers.
<P>
‘Channel groups’ are a collection of channel definitions to be started and stopped at the same time.
<P>
You can work with channels only as part of a channel group, and that channel group must belong to an  MQ connection.
<P>
To start a channel, you must start the MQ connection that owns the channel group to which the channel belongs.
<P>
MQSeries for Windows makes use of the Dial - Up support provided by Windows to connect queue managers using a dial-up telephone link.
<P>
Click each area to read more details about it, then click Next to continue.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Channel Groups</FONT>
<br>
A channel group is a named collection of channels and, optionally, the MQSeries listener.
When you start a channel group, all the objects in the group are started.  Similarly, when you stop a channel group, all the objects are stopped.
<P>
Channel groups don’t support receiver type channels, because they cannot be started.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Connections</FONT>
<br>
Only MQSeries for Windows  Version 2.1 supports the concept of a connection.
<P>
The connection definition hides the complexities of queue managers, channel groups, and  phone book entries from application users.
<P>
A user need only be concerned with deciding which connection to stop and start.
<P>
There are three types of connection: Stand-alone,  LAN and Dial-up.
<P>
A stand-alone connection does not contain channel definitions. It is for use when not connected to another queue manager.
<P>
A LAN connection contains one channel group and it is used for connection to another queue manager over a local area network.
<P>
A dial-up connection contains a channel group and one  phone book entry for use over a dial-up network.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Sample Scenario</FONT>
<br>
A sales representative collects data using a stand-alone connection which does not need a communication link to an MQSeries server.
<P>
On arrival at the office,  the data can be uploaded to an MQSeries server using a LAN connection.
<P>
When the sales rep is at a remote location with phone access, a dial-up connection can be activated to upload the data to an MQSeries server.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Dial-up support</FONT>
<br>
In order to connect to another queue manager when no LAN is available, MQSeries for Windows makes use of the built-in support features of the Windows product.
<P>
The dial-up support provided by MQSeries for Windows 2.0 is different from that provided by MQSeries for Windows 2.1.
<P>
Click the version of MQSeries for Windows for more information.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Installation</FONT>
<br>
The respective Windows platforms provide standard functions for the installation of MQSeries for Windows.
<P>
During the installation of MQSeries for Windows Version 2.0, you can select which components to install.   With version 2.1, you can choose to install the compact or the complete version.
<P>
Click each product  to read more about what can be selected during installation.
Then, click Next to continue.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Administration on Version 2.0</FONT>
<br>
MQSeries for Windows Version 2.0 installation provides access to administration utilities, sample programs, and online information.
<P>
The utilities allow a less-experienced user to administer the MQSeries queue manager.
The samples could be used to test the environment just created and any remote connections.
<P>
Online versions of the MQSeries publications are provided.
<P>
Roll the mouse over each utility to read a description of what this utility does. A complete description can be found in the <I>MQSeries for Windows Version 2.0 User’s Guide</I>.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Administration on Version 2.1</FONT>
<br>
When the complete version of MQSeries for Windows 2.1 has been installed, it can be managed from the MQSeries Properties dialogue box.
<P>
Click each tab for a description. For further information consult the <I>MQSeries for Windows Version 2.1 User’s Guide</I>.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Initialization files and definition files</FONT>
<br>
MQSeries for Windows provides for a  file to be used that contains definitions of MQSeries components that are to be created during installation, startup or  by  utility requests.
<P>
The INI file is provided on version 2.0, whereas on version 2.1 it is called an MQD file.
The main differences between these files is the flexibility in when it can be run and what it contains.
<P>
Click each file for a description of what the file does, then click Next to continue.
