<H1>MQ84 - Topic 6: Problem Determination</h1>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Connecting to the queue manager </FONT>
<br>
The request to start the queue manager is issued. <br>
If an error message is returned, indicating that the queue manager is
unavailable, look for errors associated with the configuration files.<br>
Errors in accessing the MQSeries configuration file or a misspelt queue manager name can prevent a queue manager from being found. It is important to remember that all MQSeries object names are case sensitive.
<br><br><br>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Client connection to queue manager</FONT>
<br>
The client application issues a connect call and receives the reason code of ‘queue manager unavailable’. <br>
If the Queue manager was reachable, but unable to accept the connection request, then information will be written by the queue manager to its current information log. <br>
If the failure occurs at the client interface, information will be recorded in error logs on the client machine.
<P>
Click both of the information logs for further information, then click Next to continue.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Queue manager connections</FONT>
<br>
If channels between queue managers fail, information will be recorded by each of the queue managers in their  current information log.<br>
This information will include the date and time of the event, the information message number and text that describes the event.
<P>
Also potential problem resolution activity and prior message relationship is described.
<P>
Roll the mouse over either of the information logs to see further information relating to the information logs.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Application errors</FONT>
<br>
Message channel agents record information in the queue manager information logs.
<P>
They record when the channel is started and stopped, why the channel was stopped and if  retry-able errors have occurred.
<P>
The information log messages are text messages, intended to provide for problem tracing and reason analysis.
<P>
All messages are recorded with the current date and time at Greenwich and not the local time.
<P>
If the channel agents have to put application messages on the queue manager dead letter queue, they will also record in the queue manager’s current information log when and why this was required.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Client application </FONT>
<br>
In the event of the abnormal termination of a client application, an unformatted report will be generated and written to the error directory, provided for by the MQSeries client interface. This report will include the date and time of the error, a snap of the associated memory and problem state information. This information must be interpreted and formatted by a supplied utility program. The output of this utility is provided to assist in the detection and correction of the event. The production of a report does not automatically indicate maintenance to product code is required.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Server connected application</FONT>
<br>
In the event of the abnormal termination of an application connected to the queue manager, a formatted report will be generated by components of the MQSeries product, and stored in an errors directory . The reports will include the date and time of the error, a symptom string, an image of the associated memory locations and problem state information to assist in the detection and correction of the event.
<P>
Roll the mouse over the highlighted areas for further information regarding the names and locations  and example contents of the event information logs. Then click Next to continue.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">MQSeries trace facility</FONT>
<br>
The MQSeries provided trace function allows for  detailed execution information to be recorded in a sequential manner. This information is intended to assist in analyzing performance and state problems. IBM service support personnel may ask for a problem to be recreated with trace enabled, as it provides for indepth processing path analysis. The files produced by the trace can be very large, therefore it is important to qualify the trace capture mechanism by providing selection criteria, for example, to trace by time and only record a specific component.
<P>
Further information regarding tracing is available in the MQSeries system administration publications.
