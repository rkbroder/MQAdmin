<br>
There is one input parameter on an MQDISC call:<br>
<ul>
<li>The connection handle. The connection handle was returned by a previous MQCONN call.
</ul>
<P>
This shows the name of the parameters as they appear in the <I>MQSeries Application Programming Reference</I>.
<P>
Move the mouse over the name for a brief description of the parameter and to discover its data type.
<br><br><br>

<br>
When the queue manager receives control, it performs a number of tasks.
<P>
For example, it checks that the connection handle is valid. Provided everything is in order, the connection between the application and the queue manager is broken and the connection handle becomes invalid.
<br><br><br>

<br>
There are three output parameters on an MQCLOSE call:<br>
A connection handle, a completion code and a reason code.<br>
The connection handle is set to be no longer valid if the call is successful.
<P>
Move the mouse over each name for a brief description of the parameter and to discover its data type.

The diagram now shows the order of the parameters as they appear in an MQDISC call.

<FONT SIZE="+2">Coding the MQDISC call</FONT>
<br>
Here is an example of how to code the MQDISC call.  As the MQDISC call is very simple, no commentaries on the pseudo-code are included.
<P>
Refer to the <I>MQSeries Application Programming Reference</I> if you wish to see examples, in the programming language that you use, of how the parameters of an MQDISC call are declared, and the format of the call.
