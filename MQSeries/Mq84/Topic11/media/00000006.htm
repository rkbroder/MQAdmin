<H1>MQ84 - Topic 11: Security</h1>

<FONT SIZE="+2"> Security in MQSeries</FONT>
<br>
MQSeries provides security services to enable security checking.
<P>
Click each security service for a description of what the service is. You will learn more about each service later in the topic.
<br><br><br>

<FONT SIZE="+2">Access Control</FONT>
<br>
Users or groups of users have their required level of authority over MQSeries objects granted or revoked by the MQSeries administrator. The correct level of authority is also required before commands can be issued by a user. The administrator will use the displayed commands to manage these object authority rules.
<P>
Click the commands  for examples of how they are used.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">The message context</FONT>
<br>
When a business process requires that a message be processed by successive applications a security issue arises.
<P>
The issue is, under whose authority should all the processing be performed. Should it be the individual authority of each application or a common authority inherited from the originator. MQSeries allows for applications to make this decision at the time of issuing the MQI calls. Also an area in the header of each message is provided to store information related to message ownership.
<P>
Click Next to see more details about this ownership information.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">The message context</FONT>
<br>
Message ownership information is stored in the context fields of the message header .
The message context consists of eight fields divided into two categories. They are the identity context and the origin context.
<P>
The identity context  identifies the authorized userid at the time of the message being put on the queue.  The origin context describes the application that put the message on the queue. A user with the appropriate authority can influence the queue manager in the setting of the context fields.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Summary of the context options</FONT>
<br>
Listed are the options available for the manipulation of the message context fields by the application at the time of issuing the MAI calls of OPEN, GET and PUT.
<P>
Roll the mouse over each of the options for further details.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Alternate security</FONT>
<br>
An application may be required to verify that the originator of a message has the authority to request the services of the next queue. In which case it must use a special option on the mq open call. This option identifies to the queue manager that an alternate userid is to be verified as the requester. While the actual requester is checked for the authority to request this option.
<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Security and distributed queuing</FONT>
<br>
When a message is sent to a remote queue a number of security checks are possible.
Firstly the sending application must have authority to put to the remote object, even if that object is not physically present on the originating system.
<P>
Secondly the sending message channel agent must have the authority to get and move the message over the network.
<P>
And finally the receiving message channel agent must have the required authority to deliver the message to the requested queue.
<P>
Click the transmission queue and the receiving message channel agent for move details regarding their security requirements.

<br><br><br>


<FONT SIZE="+2">Channel exits</FONT>
<br>
To implement additional security checks within a distributed environment, channel exits could be used.
<P>
Here is a list of all the channel exit programs that may be called on a message channel.
<P>
Click each exit for a description of the channel exit program.
